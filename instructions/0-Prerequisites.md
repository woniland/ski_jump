## Prerequisites
We will be using two main programs, which may be already familiar to some of you.

### Git

- Website: https://git-scm.com/
- Documentation: https://git-scm.com/doc
- The official tutorial can be found under https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial - or doing a simple search in your favorite search engine
- To get started just type `git` and if you want to know more about a specific command, e.g. `$ git commit`, just type `$ git help commit`
- The most important git commands and the typical order in which they are executed, can also be found [in the slides](../slides/topi.pdf)

While `git` is the actual program, which is doing all the heavy lifting, we will use [GitHub](https://github.com/)
as the online interface to collaborate together. GitHub is one popular choice out of many, which can host online repositories.

If you have never used `git` before, consider to configure your account:
```sh
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
```

Note that we will work only with version 2 - you can check your version with `$ git --version`.

### Python

- Website: https://www.python.org/
- Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/
- The official tutorial can be found under https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html - or doing a simple search in your favorite search engine
- To get started just type `python` to open a Python shell

Note that we will work only with version 3 (preferably >= 3.9) - you can check your version with `$ python --version`.
